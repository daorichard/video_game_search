# Video Game Discover App

### Motivation

- I wanted to build something similar to steam and showcase videogames in a more visual manner and UI-friendly way.

### Built with

- React, Redux, Styled Components
- Flexbox & Grid CSS
- RAWG.io API

### What I learned

- Utilize an API to create a responsive react single-page application
- Use redux for state management and async fetching

### Continued development

- Add testing for frontend via jest
- Add a user wishlist/favorite section

### How to run

- Clone the repo and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to boot up the project in development mode
